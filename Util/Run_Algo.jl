Implements the backtester logic
Runs the backtesting logic from the start date to the end date.
Updates the universe with each time stamp, run user defined strategy 
at every time steps and updates portfolio, orders and performance for fills

THINKING IN SIGNALS
1. Signal to update price data in the dataframe
2. When data is updated, 
a. Signal to update open orders (in backtest orders are executed at next tick)
      Signal to update the portfolio
          Signal to update the performance with new portfolio
          
          Signal to call the trading function 
              Signal to place new orders  


SIGNALS in TradingLogic (Julia)


Step 1 : Setup all signals

Signal 1: s_ohlc => A tuple (pair) value of date-time and ohlc data
Signal 2: s_pnow => s_ohlc signal tansformed to point to next value for a specified symbol
Signal 3: s_status => status signal after calling run trading function. In run trading fucntion
Signal 4: s_perf => signal after calculating the performance based on "s_status"

Step 2: Calculate equity values using above signals  running core of the backtesting


CORE of the backtesting:

1. Find the length of data
2. Initialize equity value array of the same length (from 1)
3. for each time stamp, update (push new) values to s_ohlc with next data
4. Record the equity values from the respective signals
5. Repeat 3

Nice thing: All the signals are calculated asynchronously but return final result snychronously. 
Dnt have to worry about the finishing one a unit of work to trigger next. It's automatically taken care of.

Now, define your algorithm and tehen try to setup in terms in signals
1. Initialize the trading environment
2. Initialize the brokerage, algorithm
3. for every data point:
    Step 1: Handle Symbol changes: cancel orders for symbol changes
    Step 2: Update universe: add securities 
    Step 3. Scans all the outstanding ORDERS and apply the algorithm model fills to generate the order events. New Portfolio.
    Step 4: Remove delisted securities from universe with filled orders
    Step 5: Stop algorithm if signaled stop/cancel by the user
    Step 6: Check for margin call. Release warning or liquidate.         
    Step 7. Apply Dividends and Split Adjustment to existing portfolio
    Step 8. Handle delisitng: Logic is debatable. liquidate as of last known price OR let it stay.
    Step 9: Fire Pricing Event OnData()
    Step 10: Calculate new portfolio stats based on portfolio as EOD
